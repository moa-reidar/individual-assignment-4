Design System with Interactive Components


Project Description

This project is a demonstration of a design system featuring interactive UI components. It consists of eight different components showcasing various states and functionalities. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Components:


- Buttons
States: default, hover, and active.
hover: Changes color when hovered over.
active: Changes color only when clicked.
Dropdowns

- A default dropdown that can be selected.
A disabled dropdown that cannot be interacted with.
Alerts

- Active alert: A green "Success" message.
Disabled alert: A gray message representing a disabled state.
Tooltips

- Active tooltip: Displays when hovering over a button.
Disabled tooltip: Does not display and is grayed out.
Toasts

- Active toast: Displays a blue message that disappears after some time.
Disabled toast: Appears as a gray toast without interaction.
Accordions

- One section reveals text when clicked.
Another section remains closed.
Modals

- A modal that can be opened and closed using the "Open Modal" and "Close" buttons.
Cards

- A standard card without interaction.
A card with a hover effect that changes appearance when hovered over.



Files

- HTML
index.html: Contains the structure for the project, including all components.


- CSS
reset.css: Resets default browser styles.
variables.css: Defines CSS variables for colors, typography, and spacing.
style.css: Contains styling for each component.

- JavaScript
script.js: Manages functionality for navigation, button states, modals, accordions, and more.
How It Works


Navigation:

Click on navigation links to display the corresponding component.
Only one component is visible at a time.


Interactive Components:

- Buttons: Only the correct button responds to hover or click actions.
- Modals: Opens with the "Open Modal" button and closes with the "Close" button.
- Accordions: Only one section can be open at a time.


Hover and Click States:

-Cards have hover effects.
-Buttons and other components have states that change on hover or click.


How to Run the Project
Download all the files and place them in a project folder.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Navigate through the components and interact with them.



Future Improvements
Add more states to other components.
Make the project more responsive for mobile and tablet devices.
Add animations for a more dynamic experience.
